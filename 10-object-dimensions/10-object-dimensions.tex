  {The inheritance hierarchy, a directed acyclic graph will be described as a tree structure with classes as nodes, leaves and a root. In any design application, there can be many possible \ul{hierarchies of classes}. Design choices on the hierarchy employed to represent the application are essentially choices about restricting or expanding the scope of properties of the objects in the application.}
