  {The inheritance hierarchy, a directed acyclic graph will be described as a tree structure with classes as nodes, leaves and a root. In any design application, there can be many possible \ul{hierarchies of classes}. Design choices on the hierarchy employed to represent the application are essentially choices about restricting or expanding the scope of properties of the objects in the application.}

\begin{multicols}{2}
Consider a class \(C_i\), with methods \(M_1, \dots, M_n\). Let \(c_1, \dots, c_n\) be
the complexity of the methods. Then:
\begin{equation*}
\text{WMC} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i
\end{equation*}
If all method complexities are considered to be unity, then \(\text{WMC} = n\),
the number of methods.
\par\columnbreak\par
``It can be argued that developers approach the task of writing a method as they would
a traditional program, and therefore some traditional static complexity metric,
such as McCabe's Cyclomatic number, may be appropriate.''
