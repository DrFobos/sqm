  {Cyclomatic Complexity (CC) is a count of the number of decisions in the source code. The higher the count, the more complex the code. The formula is simple: \(C=E-N+2\).}

I found this picture \href{https://craftofcoding.wordpress.com/2017/06/18/coding-a-small-note-on-cyclomatic-complexity/}{here}.}

\thought{In his presentation "\textit{Software Quality Metrics to Identify Risk}", Tom McCabe introduces the following categorisation to interpret cyclomatic complexity: 1--10 little risk, 11--20 moderate risk, 21--50 high risk, 50+ very high risk.}

  {The models developed are found to successfully \ul{predict} roughly 90\% of CCâ€™s variance by LOC alone. This suggest not only that the linear relationship between LOC and CC is stable, but the aspects of code complexity that CC measures, such as the size of the test case space, grow \ul{linearly} with source code size across languages and programming paradigms.}

  {There is a \ul{low} to moderate correlation between the effort needed to \ul{test} a program and its complexity.}

  {From the results of the experiments we conducted, we observed no significant correlation between the \ul{depth of inheritance} of a class and its weighted method complexity.}

  {As the complexity of the software increases, the probability to introduce \ul{new errors} also increases.}

  {There is a very strong correlation between Lines of Code and Halstead Volume and there is an even stronger correlation between Lines of Code and McCabe's Cyclomatic Complexity.}

\thought{What is a complexity of a class? How about a module?}

\thought{\ul{Feature creep} is one of the most common sources of cost and schedule overruns; it can even kill products and projects --- Wikipedia.}

\thought{Tom McCabe suggested to prohibit functions where CC is larger than \ul{ten}. Modern static analyzers may help you control this automatically.}

  {The complexity density ratio is demonstrated to be a useful predictor of software maintenance productivity on a small pilot sample of actual maintenance project.}
