  {Cyclomatic Complexity (CC) is a count of the number of decisions in the source code. The higher the count, the more complex the code. The formula is simple: \(C=E-N+2\).}

\thought{In his presentation "\textit{Software Quality Metrics to Identify Risk}", Tom McCabe introduces the following categorisation to interpret cyclomatic complexity: 1--10 little risk, 11--20 moderate risk, 21--50 high risk, 50+ very high risk.}

\thought{What is a complexity of a class? How about a module?}

\thought{\ul{Feature creep} is one of the most common sources of cost and schedule overruns; it can even kill products and projects --- Wikipedia.}

\thought{Tom McCabe suggested to prohibit functions where CC is larger than \ul{ten}. Modern static analyzers may help you control this automatically.}
