  [William Robert Elmendorf]
  {william-elmendorf}
  {A disciplined test control process is composed of five steps: 1) establish the intended extent of testing; 2) create a list of functional \ul{variations} eligible for testing; 3) rank and subset the \ul{eligible} variations so that test resources can be directed at those with the higher payoff; 4) calculate the \ul{test coverage} of the test case library; and 5) verify attainment of the \ul{planned} test coverage.}
  {elmendorf1969}

  {However, only half regularly document their test designs, only half regularly save their tests for reuse after software changes, and an extremely small five percent provide regular \ul{measurements} of code coverage.}

``We note an \ul{inconsistency}. A high percentage of the respondents
felt that the testing in their organization was a systematic
and organized activity (91\% answered either ``yes''
or ``sometimes'' to this practice). However, [...]
an extremely small 5\% provide \ul{regular
measurements of code coverage}.''\par

  {Junky software takes more tests to achieve coverage, but it breaks under any systematic test.}
  {beizer1995}

\lnQuote
  [Brian Marick]
  {brian-marick}
  {Coverage numbers (like many numbers) are dangerous because they're \ul{objective} but \ul{incomplete}. They too often distort sensible action. Using them in isolation is as foolish as hiring based only on GPA.}
  {marick1997}

\lnQuote
  [Martin Fowler]
  {martin-fowler}
  {I would be suspicious of anything like 100\% --- it would smell of someone writing tests to make the coverage \ul{numbers happy}, but not thinking about what they are doing.}
  {fowler1997}

\lnQuote
  [Cem Kaner]
  {cem-kaner}
  {As you get near 100 percent line coverage, that doesn't tell you the product is near release. It just tells you that the product is no longer \ul{obviously far} from release according to \ul{this measure}.}
  {kaner2002}

\lnQuote
  [Pavneet Singh Kochhar, David Lo, Julia Lawall, Nachiappan Nagappan]
  {pavneet-singh-kochhar}
  {Our results show that coverage has an \ul{insignificant correlation} with the number of bugs that are found after the release of the software at the project level, and \ul{no such correlation} at the file level.}
  {kochhar2017}

\lnQuote
  [Goran Petrovi{\'c}]
  {goran-petrovic}
  {Google \ul{does not enforce} any code coverage thresholds across the entire codebase. Projects (or groups of projects) are free to define their own thresholds and goals. Many projects opt-into a centralized voluntary alerting system that defines \ul{five levels} of code coverage thresholds.}
  {ivankovi2019}

\lnQuote
  [Adam Bender]
  {adam-bender}
  {Code coverage \ul{does not guarantee} that the covered lines or branches have been tested correctly, it just guarantees that they have been executed by a test. But a low code coverage number \ul{does guarantee} that large areas of the product are going completely untested by automation on every single deployment.}
  {arguelles2020}

\lnQuote
  {../15-code-coverage/survey}
  {Many \ul{contracts} are specifying that a certain \ul{percentage} of the statements or instructions must be successfully executed before the acceptance of the software by the customer.}
