``A limitation of measuring code deltas is that it
doesnâ€™t give an indicator as to how much change the
system has undergone. If several
software modules are removed and are replaced by
modules of roughly equivalent complexity, the code
delta for the system will be close to zero.''

  {Our case study provides strong support for the following conclusion: increase in relative code churn measures is accompanied by an increase in system \ul{defect density}.}

  {We can conclude that committing files with higher cumulative code churn values (i.e. those of longer change history) is more likely to result in negative maintainability change.}

\pitch{\pptQuote{tobias-olsson.jpg}{Non-normal code churn can be a tangible and measurable \ul{effect} of architectural violations in source code. However, more research is needed to better understand this connection, e.g., if violations are the \ul{cause}, the size of the effect, the cost of refactoring, and whether it is generalizable to other system.}{\textit{The Relationship of Code Churn and Architectural Violations in

``When we have finished analyzing your default branch, you will see churn metrics for the files in your repository. This churn metric is approximately the \ul{number of times a file has changed} in the last 90 days, calculated by counting the number of distinct versions of that file across commits from that time.''\par
