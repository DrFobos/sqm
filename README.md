There are slides for my series of lectures for [HSE University](https://www.hse.ru/en/) (Moscow, Russia).

All recorded videos (so far) are in [this YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaIsQH4uc08xyXRhhYPHh-Yam2kEwNaLl) (все лекции по-русски!).

All compiled slide decks in PDF are [here](https://yegor256.github.io/sqm/).

To compile everything just run:

```bash
$ make
```

To clean everything up, do:

```
$ make clean
```
