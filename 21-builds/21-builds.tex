  {In general, there may be more internal releases to the development team, with only a few executable releases turned over to external parties. The internal releases represent a sort of \ul{continuous integration} of the system and exist to force closure on some key system areas.}

  {Regardless of how often individual developers check in their changes to the source code, a designated developer, called the project \ul{build master}, generates a complete build of the product on a daily basis using the master version of the source code.}

  {Developers need freedom to make changes where they make the most sense. Therefore, \ul{integrate} and \ul{test} several times a day. Throw away unintegrated code after a couple of days and start over. Ignore code ownership. Program in pairs. Don't integrate \ul{without unit tests}.}

  {For most projects, the XP guideline of a \ul{ten minute} build is perfectly within reason. Most of our modern projects achieve this. It's worth putting in concentrated effort to make it happen, because every minute chiseled off the build time is a minute \ul{saved} for each developer every time they commit.}

  {Our results show there are good reasons for the rise of CI. Compared to projects that do not use CI, projects that use CI: \ul{release} twice as often, \ul{accept pull requests} faster (1.6x), and have developers who are \ul{less worried} about breaking the build.}

  \item Almost 16\% of our 4.2M tests have some level of flakiness
  \item 84\% of transitions from Pass -> Fail are from `flaky' tests
  \item We spend up to 16\% of our compute resources re-running flaky tests
  \item Certain people/automation more likely to cause breakages (oops!)
  \item Certain languages more likely to cause breakages (sorry)

  {Process metrics have a significant impact on the build outcome in 8 of the 14 projects on average, but the strongest influencing factor across all projects is \ul{overall stability} in the \ul{recent build history}. For 10 projects, more than 50\% (up to 80\%) of all failed builds follow a previous build failure.}

  {FlakeSync works by \ul{identifying} a critical point, representing some key part of code that must be executed early w.r.t. other concurrently executing code, and a barrier point, representing the part of code that should wait until the critical point has been executed. FlakeSync can \ul{modify} code to check when the critical point is executed and have the barrier point keep waiting until the critical point has been executed, essentially synchronizing these two parts of code for the specific test execution.}
