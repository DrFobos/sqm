  {\textbf{Lint} is a command which examines C source programs, detecting a number of \ul{bugs} and \ul{obscurities}. It enforces the type rules of C more strictly than the C compilers. It may also be used to enforce a number of \ul{portability restrictions} involved in moving programs between different machines and/or operating systems. Another option detects a number of \ul{wasteful}, or \ul{error prone}, constructions which nevertheless are, strictly speaking, legal.}
