  {While our experience in applying statistical quality-control techniques to software development is limited, initial experience indicates that \ul{five fixes per thousand lines of code} can be tolerated without invalidating the application of statistics to estimate MTTF. This failure rate is low compared to normal development practices, where \ul{20 to 60} fixes per thousand lines of code is \ul{not atypical}.}

  {Industry average experience is about 1-25 errors per 1000 lines of code for delivered software. Cases that have one-tenth as many errors as this are rare; cases that have 10 times more tend not to be reported. (They probably aren't ever completed!) Microsoft experiences about 10â€“20 defects per 1000 lines of code during in-house testing and 0.5 defects per 1000 lines of code in released product.}

  {Although we found some support for findings in recent literature that \ul{smaller files} have higher defects density, we found further evidence that \ul{very large} or \ul{complex} files have lower defect densities and in some cases even lower defect proneness. Our findings have immediate practical implications: the redistribution of Java code into smaller and less complex files may be \ul{counterproductive}.}
