``One \ul{surprising} result was that module \ul{size} did not account for error proneness. In fact, it was quite the contrary---the larger the module, the \ul{less} error prone it was. This was true even though the larger modules were more complex.''\par

``This measure has a degree of \ul{indeterminism}. For example, a low value may indicate either a good process and a good product or it may indicate a bad process. If the value is low compared to similar past projects, the inspection process should be examined. If the inspection process is found to be adequate, it should then be concluded that the development process has resulted in a \ul{relatively defect-free} product.''

  {While our experience in applying statistical quality-control techniques to software development is limited, initial experience indicates that \ul{five fixes per thousand lines of code} can be tolerated without invalidating the application of statistics to estimate MTTF. This failure rate is low compared to normal development practices, where \ul{20 to 60} fixes per thousand lines of code is \ul{not atypical}.}

  {Our critical review of state-of-the-art of models for predicting software defects has shown that many methodological and theoretical \ul{mistakes} have been made... We recommend holistic models for software defect prediction, using Bayesian Belief Networks, as alternative approaches to the single-issue models used at present.}

  {Industry average experience is about 1-25 errors per 1000 lines of code for delivered software. Cases that have one-tenth as many errors as this are rare; cases that have 10 times more tend not to be reported. (They probably aren't ever completed!) Microsoft experiences about 10â€“20 defects per 1000 lines of code during in-house testing and 0.5 defects per 1000 lines of code in released product.}
