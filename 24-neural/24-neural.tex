  {\ul{Neural} software analysis offers a fresh approach, enhancing or even \ul{surpassing} traditional program analysis in some areas.}

  {We conclude that the application of machine learning to the detection of [these] \ul{code smells} can provide high accuracy (>96\%), and only a hundred training examples are needed to reach at least 95\% accuracy.}

  {Among the true positives, we found pairs mapping to all four clone types. We compared our approach to a traditional structure-oriented technique and found that our learning-based approach \ul{detected clones} that were either undetected or suboptimally reported by the prominent tool Deckard.}

  {In this paper we present a new, automated approach for creating static analyzers: instead of manually providing the various inference rules of the analyzer, the key idea is to \ul{learn} these \ul{rules} from a \ul{dataset} of programs.}

  {The meanings of `Canada' and `Air' cannot be easily combined to obtain `Air Canada'. Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good \ul{vector representations} for millions of phrases is possible.}

  {This paper presents DeepBugs, a learning approach to name-based bug detection, which reasons about names based on a semantic representation and which automatically learns bug detectors instead of manually writing them. We formulate bug detection as a \ul{binary classification problem} and train a classifier that distinguishes \ul{correct} from \ul{incorrect} code.}

  {While \citet{arcelli2016comparing} opened a new perspective for code smell detection, in the context of our research we found a number of possible \ul{limitations} that might threaten the results of this study. Our findings show that the high performance achieved in their study was in fact due to the \ul{specific dataset} employed rather than the actual capabilities of machine-learning techniques for code smell detection.}

  {\textbf{code2vec}: The main idea is to represent a code snippet as a single fixed-length \ul{code vector}, which can be used to \ul{predict} semantic properties of the snippet.}

  {SkipAnalyzer consists of three components, 1) an LLM-based static bug detector that scans source code and reports specific types of bugs, 2) an LLM-based false positive filter, and 3) an LLM-based patch generator that can generate patches for the detected bugs above. As a proof-of-concept, SkipAnalyzer is built on \ul{ChatGPT}.}

  {UBITect produces many \ul{false positives} from the static analysis. With a pilot study of 20 false positives, we can successfully \ul{prune} 8 out of 20 based on GPT-3.5, whereas GPT-4 had a near-perfect result of 16 out of 20.}
