  {\ul{Neural} software analysis offers a \ul{fresh} approach, enhancing or even \ul{surpassing} traditional program analysis in some areas.}

  {\textbf{code2vec}: The main idea is to represent a code snippet as a single fixed-length \ul{code vector}, which can be used to \ul{predict} semantic properties of the snippet.}

  {SkipAnalyzer consists of three components, 1) an LLM-based static bug detector that scans source code and reports specific types of bugs, 2) an LLM-based false positive filter, and 3) an LLM-based patch generator that can generate patches for the detected bugs above. As a proof-of-concept, SkipAnalyzer is built on \ul{ChatGPT}.}

  {UBITect produces many false positives from the static analysis. With a pilot study of 20 false positives, we can successfully prune 8 out of 20 based on GPT-3.5, whereas GPT-4 had a near-perfect result of 16 out of 20.}
