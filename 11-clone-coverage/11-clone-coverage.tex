  [Edward Yourdon]
  {edward-yourdon}
  {Whenever possible, we wish to maximize \ul{fan-in} during the design process. Fan-in is the \textit{raison d'\^{e}tre} of modularity: Each instance of multiple fan-in means that some \ul{duplicate code} has been avoided.}
  {yourdon1979structured}

\lnQuote
  [Bertrand Meyer]
  {bertrand-meyer}
  {The challenge of reusability is to avoid \ul{unneeded duplication} of software by taking advantage of the commonality between variants. If identical or near-identical fragments appear in different modules, it will be difficult to \ul{guarantee} their integrity and to ensure that changes or corrections \ul{get propagated} to all the needed places.}

  {\textbf{The Rule of Three}: The \ul{first} time you do something, you just do it. The \ul{second} time you do something similar, you wince at the duplication, but you do the duplicate thing anyway. The \ul{third} time you do something similar, you refactor.}

\lnQuote
  [Kent Beck]
  {kent-beck}
  {You must find a way to eliminate all the duplicated logic in the system. This is the hardest part of design for me, because you first have to find the duplication, and then you have to find a way to eliminate it. Eliminating duplication naturally leads you to create \ul{lots of little objects} and lots of little methods, because otherwise there will inevitably be duplication.}
  {beck2000extreme}

\lnQuote
  {steve-mcconnell}
  {With code in one place, you save the space that would have been used by duplicated code. Modifications will be easier because you'll need to modify the code in \ul{only one location}. The code will be more reliable because you'll have to check only one place to ensure that the code is right.}

  {The problem with code cloning is that errors in the original must be fixed in every copy. Other kinds of maintenance changes, for instance, extensions or adaptations, must be applied \ul{multiple times}, too. Yet, it is usually not documented \ul{where} code was copied.}
