\thought{Everybody wants higher \emph{quality of code}, but nobody knows how to measure it.}

\thought{Code \emph{maintainability}, probably, is the ultimate objective of increasing the quality of source code.}

\thought{Code \emph{size} makes the biggest negative impact on code maintainability.}

\thought{It \emph{may} be wrong to measure productivity of a programmer by counting lines of code, but for the quality of code the LoC metric is a perfect indicator.}

\thought{Instead of counting lines, it may be more reasonable to count NCSS (Non Commenting Source Statements), but not always.}

\thought{There are \href{https://www.linux.com/news/linux-in-2020-27-8-million-lines-of-code-in-the-kernel-1-3-million-in-systemd/}{27.8M} lines of C code in Linux kernel. What does it tell us?}

\thought{In 2011, Uncle Bob \href{https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/66523}{suggested} that 200 lines per Java class is a good guideline to stay below.}

\thought{Java is \href{http://jameshfisher.github.io/languageredundancy/}{two times} more verbose than Ruby. Does it mean the quality of an average Ruby code is higher?}
