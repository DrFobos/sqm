  {A guiding principle in the formulation of Cognitive Complexity has been that it should incent \ul{good} coding practices. That is, it should either ignore or discount features that make code more readable.}

  ``The mathematical model underlying \ul{Cyclomatic Complexity} gives these two
  methods equal weight, yet it is intuitively obvious that the control flow of
  \ff{sumOfPrimes} is more difficult to understand than that of \ff{getWords}.''

  ``The \ul{Cognitive Complexity} algorithm gives these two methods markedly different
  scores, ones that are far more reflective of their relative understandability.''

  {Being able to find statistical correlations between code \ul{understandability} and source code \ul{measures} would be greatly beneficial for the software development process, which involves a great deal of activities involving program \ul{comprehension}.}
