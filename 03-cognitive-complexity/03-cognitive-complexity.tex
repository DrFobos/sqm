  {By cognitive complexity we mean the \ul{mental burden} of the persons who have to deal with the class. We \ul{assume} that it is the, sometimes necessary, high cognitive complexity of a class which causes it to display undesirable external qualities, such as decreased maintainability and testability, or increased fault-proneness.}

  {Cognitive complexity, the \ul{new measure} for software complexity presented in this paper, is a measure of the cognitive and psychological complexity of software as a human intelligence artifact.}

  ``The cognitive weight of software is the degree of difficulty or relative time and effort required for comprehending a given piece of software modelled by a number of BCSs. The total cognitive weight of a software component, \(W_c\), is defined as the sum of the cognitive weights of its \(q\) linear blocks composed of individual BCSs.''
