  {A guiding principle in the formulation of Cognitive Complexity has been that it should incent good coding practices. That is, it should either ignore or discount features that make code more readable.}

``The mathematical model underlying \ul{Cyclomatic Complexity} gives these two
methods equal weight, yet it is intuitively obvious that the control flow of
\ff{sumOfPrimes} is more difficult to understand than that of \ff{getWords}''

``The \ul{Cognitive Complexity} algorithm gives these two methods markedly different
scores, ones that are far more reflective of their relative understandability.''

  {Being able to find statistical correlations between code understandability and source code measures would be greatly beneficial for the software development process, which involves a great deal of activities involving program comprehension.}
