\pitch{\pptBanner{Monolithic Repositories}
{\small\begin{description}
\item[Centralization]
  The codebase is contained in a single repo encompassing multiple projects.
\item[Visibility]
  Code is viewable and searchable by all engineers in the organization.
\item[Synchronization:]
  The development process is trunk-based; engineers commit to the head of the repo.
\item[Completeness]
  Any project in the repo can be built only from dependencies also checked into the repo.
  Dependencies are unversioned; projects must use whatever version of their dependency is at the repo head.
\item[Standardization]
  A shared set of tooling governs how engineers interact with the code, including building, testing, browsing, and reviewing code.

\pitch{\pptBanner{Benefits of ``Manyrepo'' Approach}
{\small\begin{description}
\item[Encapsulation]
  Each repo encapsulates and hides its details from everybody else.
\item[Fast Builds]
  When a repo is small, the time its automated build takes is small.
\item[Accurate Metrics]
  Calculating LoC for a large repository doesn't make any sense.
\item[Homogeneous Tasks]
  It's easier to make tasks similar in size and complexity.
\item[Single Coding Standard]
  Smaller repositories look more beautiful.
\item[Short Names]
  Smaller namespaces mean better maintainability.
\item[Simple Tests]
  More dependencies are difficult to mock and test.
